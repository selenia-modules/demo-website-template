# demo-website

##### Demonstration Website made with Selenia

This simple website will be installed as a project module into your application's `private/modules` folder.

It will **not** be installed as a composer package, so it will become part of your application and it will be submitted to
Git with it.

## Installation

To install this template on your application, using the terminal, `cd` to your app's directory and type:

```bash
workman install template selenia/demo-website
```

> **Warning**: this package cannot be installed with Composer. You must use the `workman` CLI.
